Overall Flow:
Calculate total combinations and display all possible combinations and their probabilities for the original dice (Part-A).
Attempt to undo Loki's mischief by generating new combinations for Die A and Die B (Part-B).
Check if the probabilities of sums remain unchanged after reattaching spots.
Display the new dice configurations and their probabilities.


Note:
The code uses a combination of nested loops, maps, and sets to efficiently calculate combinations and probabilities.
The undoomDice function ensures that the new dice configuration satisfies Loki's conditions while maintaining the original probabilities.
